## List 📃

### 🛠️ Hackings tools

#### RECON 👁️

* [NMAP](cheatsheets/tools/recon/nmap.md) - Nmap \("Network Mapper"\) is a free and open source \(license\) utility for network discovery and security auditing.
* [Sublist3r](cheatsheets/tools/recon/sublist3r.md) - Sublist3r is a python tool designed to enumerate subdomains of websites using OSINT.
* [GoBuster](cheatsheets/tools/recon/gobuster.md) - Gobuster is a tool used to brute-force: URis in web sites, DNS subdomains, Virtual host names on target web servers and open Amazon S3 buckets.
* [Dirb](cheatsheets/tools/recon/dirb.md) - Dirb is a Web Content Scanner. It looks for existing \(and/or hidden\) Web Objects.
* [wfuzz](cheatsheets/tools/recon/wfuzz.md) - This simple concept allows any input to be injected in any field of an HTTP request, allowing to perform complex web security attacks in different web application components such as: parameters, authentication, forms, directories/files, headers, etc.

#### SQLI
* [SQLMap](cheatsheets/tools/SQLi/sqlmap.md) - sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers.

### 🐛 Vulns

* [XSS](cheatsheets/vulns/XSS.md) - Cross-Site Scripting \(XSS\) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.
* [SQLi](cheatsheets/vulns/SQLi.md) - A SQL injection attack consists of insertion or “injection” of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application.

### 🌀 Miscellaneous

* [Reverse shells](cheatsheets/miscellaneous/reverse_shells.md) - A reverse shell is a shell session established on a connection that is initiated from a remote machine, not from the local host.

* [Interactive shell](cheatsheets/miscellaneous/interactive_shell.md) - Often during pen tests you may obtain a shell without having tty, yet wish to interact further with the system. Here are some commands which will allow you to spawn a tty shell. Obviously some of this will depend on the system environment and installed packages.
